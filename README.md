### ExplainableCNN:
Explainable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aim to make the decision-making processes of CNNs more transparent and interpretable. Traditional CNNs are often considered "black boxes" due to their complex architectures and lack of interpretability. To address this, various methods have been developed to provide insights into their inner workings.
